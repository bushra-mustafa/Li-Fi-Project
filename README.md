# Quality of Service Evaluation of LiFi-Based Transmission: Simulation and Performance Analysis

##Abstract

As a wireless connectivity solution with low latency and high capacity, visible light communication (VLC) is particularly attractive for high-speed applications such as an image or real-time
video transmission. Light-Fidelity (Li-Fi) is an emerging technology for wireless optical networking using the concept of Visible light communication (VLC).
The development of a Light-emitting-diode (LED) brought extraordinary progression in which visible light communication is performed.
LEDs can be used for transmitting the information.VLC uses LED as the transmitter which sends information by blinking the light which will be unnoticeable to the natural eyes.
This project aims to learn about Li-Fi technology and perform simulations using MATLAB for performance analysis, with the use simple line of sight (LOS) channel model is possible to understand, how the optical power distribution in a LOS path through the room. Also, calculating the
quality of service (QOS) when sending a random-signal using two modulations On-Off-keying
(OOK) and Pulse Position Modulation (L-PPM) through the Bit Error Ratio (BER) function,
and the Mean squared error (MSE) function when sending the image using two modulation
Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)
